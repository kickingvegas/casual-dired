* Casual Dired
An opinionated [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]]-based user interface for the Emacs file manager [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html][Dired]].

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-screenshot.png]]

* Motivation
While highly functional, Dired has a steep learning curve as it relies on single-key bindings for many of its commands. Menus are a user interface (UI) affordance that offer users discoverability and recall that can lower Dired's learning curve. While menus are commonly associated with mouse-driven UI, the inclusion of Transient in Emacs core allows for a menu UI that is keyboard-driven. Casual Dired endeavors to offer this as many Emacs users prefer keyboard-driven workflows.

** Goals
- To provide a keyboard-driven menu UI to Dired.
- To provide casual access to common file manager operations.

** Non-Goals
- Full coverage of all Dired commands. Casual Dired is not intended to be a power user tool.
- Strict adherence to default Dired keybindings. That said, most Dired keybindings are honored.
- Strict adherence to Dired command naming. While Casual Dired is *mostly* in alignment with Dired’s command naming, there are cases where it will make an opinionated change if the name is deemed too vague or idiomatic.
- UX Stability (for now). Given that Casual Dired is early in its life-cycle, expect changes to its user experience in terms of menu hierarchy and keybinding choices in future releases.

* Requirements

Casual Dired has been verified with the following configuration. 
- Emacs 29.3 (macOS 14.4.1, Ubuntu Linux 22.04.4 LTS)
- GNU ~ls~ (coreutils 9.5, 8.32)

The Casual Dired /Sort By/ feature relies on the installation of GNU ~ls~ which must be configured (typically via ~PATH~) so it is available to Emacs. There is no checking by Casual Dired to verify that GNU ~ls~ is installed.

Users with earlier versions of GNU coreutils may still be able to use Casual Dired.

* Asks
As Casual Dired is new, we are looking for early adopters! Your [[https://github.com/kickingvegas/casual-dired/discussions][feedback]] is welcome as it will likely impact Casual Dired's evolution, particularly with regards to UI.

* Install
If installed via MELPA then add these lines to your Emacs initialization file with your binding of preference. 
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-dired) 
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-dired-tmenu)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "s" #'casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu) ; optional
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "/" #'casual-dired-search-replace-tmenu) ; optional
#+end_src

If you use ~use-package~, here is the recipe for installing it.
#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (use-package casual-dired
    :ensure t
    :bind (:map dired-mode-map
                ("C-o" . #'casual-dired-tmenu)
                ("s" . #'casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu)
                ("/" . #'casual-dired-search-replace-tmenu)))
#+end_src

In addition to binding the main menu ~casual-dired-tmenu~, the user can also bind the sort-by menu ~casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu~ and the search & replace menu ~casual-dired-search-replace-tmenu~. 

Included is a standard keymap for Dired sorting commands (~casual-dired-sort-menu~) which can be included in a context menu for a mouse-driven workflow. An example of this is shown below:

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'casual-dired)

  (defun casual-dired-context-menu-addons (menu click)
    "Customize context MENU with CLICK event."
    (easy-menu-add-item menu nil casual-dired-sort-menu)
    menu)

  (add-hook 'context-menu-functions #'casual-dired-context-menu-addons)
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'context-menu-mode)
#+end_src

For users running on Microsoft Windows, use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/efaq-w32/Dired-ls.html][this guidance]] to configure GNU ~ls~ for running with Dired.

Casual requires Emacs 29.1+.

* Usage
1. Invoke ~M-x dired~ to launch Dired.
2. When the point is in the Dired window, invoke ~C-o~ (or a binding of your choosing) to launch the Casual Dired menu.

** Enhanced Sorting
Casual Dired offers enhanced sorting capabilities through GNU ~ls~. Use this to sort your Dired buffer to preference. Filter dot files (.*) by disabling the ~--all~ option is available here.

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-sort-by-screenshot.png]]

With the *Sort By* menu raised, one can save the switch settings for future use via the binding ~C-x C-s~ (~transient-save~). Note this is a global setting and will apply to all future calls to the *Sort By* menu.

** Search & Replace
Search and replace in multiple marked files using the ~/~ /Search & Replace/ menu item. This will raise a menu of Dired commands that will work on marked files. 

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-search-replace.png]]

While most Dired commands use Emacs-style [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Regular-Expressions.html][regular expression syntax]], there are two commands that instead take instead *grep*-style syntax:

- (~g~) Find regex… (~dired-do-find-regexp~)
- (~G~) Find regex and replace… (~dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace~)

The *grep*-style syntax is dependent on the ~grep~ implementation that is installed and used by Emacs.

** Bulk Dired Operations
Casual Dired organizes a number of Dired commands that work on a set of marked files. These commands are presented in the *Utils* menu.

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-utils-screenshot.png]]

* Configuration

As Dired has been around for a long time, the different ways of configuring it are myriad. Described below is a configuration used by the author that is consistent with the bindings used in Casual Dired.

** Initialization

#+begin_src elisp :lexical no
  (require 'dired)
  (require 'dired-x)
  (require 'wdired)
  (require 'hl-line)
  (require 'mouse)
  (require 'image-dired)
  (require 'image-dired-dired)
  (require 'casual-dired)

  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "C-o" #'casual-dired-tmenu)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "s" #'casual-dired-sort-by-tmenu)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "/" #'casual-dired-search-replace-tmenu)

  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'hl-line-mode)
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'context-menu-mode)
  (add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'dired-async-mode)
  (add-hook
   'dired-mode-hook
   (lambda ()
     (setq-local mouse-1-click-follows-link 'double)))

  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "M-o" #'dired-omit-mode)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "E" #'wdired-change-to-wdired-mode)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "M-n" #'dired-next-dirline)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "M-p" #'dired-prev-dirline)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "]" #'dired-next-subdir)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "[" #'dired-prev-subdir)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "A-M-<mouse-1>" #'browse-url-of-dired-file)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "<backtab>" #'dired-prev-subdir)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "TAB" #'dired-next-subdir)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map "M-j" #'dired-goto-subdir)
  (keymap-set dired-mode-map ";" #'image-dired-dired-toggle-marked-thumbs)

  (keymap-set image-dired-thumbnail-mode-map "n" #'image-dired-display-next)
  (keymap-set image-dired-thumbnail-mode-map "p" #'image-dired-display-previous)
#+end_src

** Variables

Casual Dired offers a settings menu to customize a set of commonly used Dired variables. Use this to customize your Dired behavior to taste.

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-settings-screenshot.png]]

If you have GNU ~ls~ installed and configured, use the ~l~ key to set the variable ~dired-use-ls-dired~ to ~t~ ("Use GNU ‘ls’ with --dired"). Otherwise this should be disabled.

** Unicode Symbol Support

By enabling “Use Unicode Symbols” from the Settings menu, Casual Dired will use Unicode symbols as appropriate in its menus. An example is shown below.

[[file:docs/images/casual-dired-screenshot-unicode.png]]

To ensure proper layout and spacing, your default typeface should be fixed-width or monospace and *must* support the Unicode symbols used.

* Common Menu Actions
Casual Dired is built using Transient menus and as such adopts much of its default behavior.

Each menu item has a /key/ and a /label/. The /key/ is what is typed by the user to select the menu item. A key can be prefixed with a meta (M-) or control (C-) key. Labels ending with a ~>~ character indicates that it will open another menu.

Dismissing a menu regardless of how deep you are in sub-menus can be done by entering ~C-q~. A menu can also be dismissed by entering ~C-g~, but this will return you to the parent menu.

If a mouse is available, a menu item can be selected by moving the mouse cursor over its label and pressing down button 1.

Pressing the ~?~ key will toggle help for all the menu items. Press the key of interest to get help for it.

Some menus (in particular the /Sort By/ menu) have arguments (example ~--all~) which you can set. You can persist these settings by typing ~C-x C-s~.

When a Transient menu is raised, a prefix argument (~C-u~) can be entered before selecting a menu item.

** Menu item notation
The following conventions are used to denote menu items.

If the label ends with a ~›~, it is a sub-menu.

If the label ends with an ~…~, the command will prompt you for an input value.
