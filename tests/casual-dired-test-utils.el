  "Transient suffix testbench for BINDING and CMD in MENU testing VALUE.
This function is intended to test a Transient suffix binding
only. It does not exercise the actual command itself.

MENU - Transient prefix
BINDING - keybinding for suffix (menu item) to be tested
CMD - suffix (menu item) function to be overridden
VALUE - value to test against the top of the Calc stack

This function creates a testbench to exercise a menu item
command (Transient suffix) in a menu (prefix). The command
associated with that binding is overridden to instead push a
value to the top of the Calc stack. This value is then tested."

  "Test runner for suffixes in MENU specified in TEST-VECTORS testing VALUE-FN.
This function executes `casualt-testbench-transient-suffix' for all elements
in TEST-VECTORS.

TEST-VECTORS - alist of (keysequence . command-function) elements
MENU - Transient prefix
VALUE-FN - function generator of value to test against on top of the Calc stack

An element in TEST-VECTOR consists of the following:

keysequence - a key sequence to be exercised by `execute-kbd-macro'
command-function - suffix command to be overridden

command-function is overridden to push the result of VALUE-FN
onto the top of the Calc stack.  This value is subsequently
compared to test that the binding is working as expected.

The value of keysequence is typically the keybinding value of the
command (suffix). However if the suffix does not dismiss the
Transient prefix that calls it, then the sequence should include
values which trigger dismissal of the prefix. An example would be
appending \"q\" to the keysequence."
